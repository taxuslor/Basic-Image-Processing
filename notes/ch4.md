> Frequency: The number of times that a periodic function repeats the same sequence of values during a unit variation of the independent variable.

## 4.1

- Any periodic function can be expressed as the sum of sine and cosine functions of different frequencies, where each function is multiplied by a different coefficient. Non-periodic functions can also be expressed as sinusoidal and/or cosine functions multiplied by the integral of a weighted function.
- Functions represented by Fourier series or transformations can be completely reconstructed by the inverse process without loss of information.

## 4.2

- The Fourier transform of the convolution of two functions in the spatial domain is equal to the product of the Fourier transform of the two functions in the frequency domain.
- The convolution of the frequency domain is similar to the product of the spatial domain, which is related by the Fourier forward and inverse transforms, respectively.
- DFT(Discrete Fourier Transform) & IDFT(Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform)

## 4.3

- Sampling theorm: If samples are obtained at a sampling rate that exceeds twice the maximum frequency of the function, then the continuous band-limited function can be fully recovered from its sample set.

TODO: The Mathmatics is really hard.
